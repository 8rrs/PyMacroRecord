Then, to stop the recording, you simply click on the black square or press the `escape` key (By default).\
To play a recording, you just need to click on the green play icon or press the `p` key (By default).

# Save, Load and clear a record
To save a record, you can do `ctrl + s` or by clicking on `File` and `Save` or `Save as` and it will open a file explorer window (if you haven't already saved yet).
