# My computer detects this program as a Virus

This is normal; my program is completely unknown to Windows, so at first, it may be considered a virus. However, this is a false positive, so don't worry.\
You can still check the code; this is an open-source program.
\
\
But if you're still unsure, you can follow these steps to avoid the setup.exe:

- Download the source code like this:

- Extract it wherever you want.
- Open the command prompt by typing "cmd" in your Windows search.
- Type the following commands separately:
  ```bash
  pip install pynput
  pip install requests
  pip install Pillow
  pip install pystray
  ```
- After that, type cmd here, then press enter:

- Finally, type: python software.py
- And boom! The software is now ready to use.
